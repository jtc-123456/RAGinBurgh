Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a manuscript in 1717, and later that year European traders established posts and settlements in the area.[10]Europeans first began to settle in the region in 1748, when the firstOhio Company, aVirginianland speculation company, won a grant of 200,000 acres (800 km2) in the upper Ohio Valley. From a post at present-dayCumberland, Maryland, the company began to construct an 80-mile (130 km)wagon roadto theMonongahela River[11]employing a Lenape Indian chief namedNemacolinand a party of settlers headed by Capt.Michael Cresapto begin widening the track into a road. It mostly followed the same route as an existing Native American trail[12]now known asNemacolin's Trail. Theriver crossingand flats atRedstone creek, was theearliest pointand shortest distance for the descent of a wagon road. Later in the war, the site fortified asFort Burd(nowBrownsville) was one of several possible destinations. Another alternative was the divergent route that becameBraddock's Roada few years later through present-dayNew Stanton. In the event, the colonists did not succeed in turning the path into a wagon road much beyond theCumberland Narrowspassbefore they came into conflict with Native Americans. The colonists later mounted a series of expeditions in order to accomplish piecemeal improvements to the track.",
            "The nearby Native American community ofLogstownwas an important trade and council center in the Ohio Valley.[6]Between June 15 and November 10, 1749, an expedition headed byCeleron de Bienville, a French officer, traveled down the Allegheny and Ohio to bolster the French claim to the region.[12]De Bienville warned away British traders and posted markers claiming the territory.[13]",
            "In 1753,Marquis Duquesne, theGovernor of New France, sent another, larger expedition. At present-dayErie, Pennsylvania, an advance party builtFort Presque Isle. They also cut a road through the woods and builtFort Le BoeufonFrench Creek, from which it was possible at high water to float to the Allegheny. By summer, an expedition of 1,500 French and Native American men descended the Allegheny. Some wintered at the confluence of French Creek and the Allegheny. The following year, they builtFort Machaultat that site.[14]",
            "Alarmed at these French incursions in the Ohio Valley,Governor Dinwiddieof Virginia sent MajorGeorge Washingtonto warn the French to withdraw.[15]Accompanied byChristopher Gist, Washington arrived at the Forks of the Ohio on November 25, 1753.",
            "As I got down before the Canoe, I spent some Time in viewing the Rivers, & the Land in the Fork, which I think extremely well situated for a Fort; as it has the absolute Command of both Rivers. The Land at the Point is 20 or 25 feet (7.6 m) above the common Surface of the Water; & a considerable Bottom of flat well timber'd Land all around it, very convenient for Building.",

On February 17, 1754, Trent began construction of the fort, the first European habitation[17]at the site of present-dayPittsburgh. The fort, namedFort Prince George, was only half-built by April 1754, when over 500 French forces arrived and ordered the 40-some colonials back to Virginia. The French tore down the British fortification and constructedFort Duquesne.[14][15]",
            "Governor Dinwiddie launched another expedition. Colonel Joshua Fry commanded the regiment with his second-in-command, George Washington, leading an advance column. On May 28, 1754, Washington's unit clashed with the French in theBattle of Jumonville Glen, during which 13 French soldiers were killed and 21 were taken prisoner.[18]After the battle, Washington's ally, Seneca chiefTanaghrisson, unexpectedly executed the French commanding officer, EnsignJoseph Coulon de Jumonville. The French pursued Washington and on July 3, 1754, George Washington surrendered following theBattle of Fort Necessity. These frontier actions contributed to the start of theFrench and Indian War(1754–1763), or, theSeven Years' War, a global confrontation between Britain and France fought in both hemispheres.[15][19]",
            "In 1755, theBraddock Expeditionwas launched, accompanied byVirginia militiaofficerGeorge Washington. Two regiments marched fromFort Cumberlandacross theAllegheny Mountainsand into western Pennsylvania. Following a path Washington surveyed, over 3,000 men built a wagon road 12 feet (3.7 m) wide, that when complete, was the first road to cross theAppalachian Mountains.Braddock's Road, as it was known, blazed the way for the futureNational Road(US40). The expedition crossed theMonongahela Riveron July 9, 1755. French troops from Fort Duquesne ambushed Braddock's expedition atBraddock's Field, nine miles (14 km) from Fort Duquesne.[20]In theBattle of the Monongahela, the French inflicted heavy losses on the British, and Braddock was mortally wounded.[21]The surviving British and colonial forces retreated. This left the French and their Native American allies with dominion over the upper Ohio valley.[15]",

On the night of September 13–14, 1758, an advance column underMajor James Grantwas annihilated in theBattle of Fort Duquesne.[21]The battleground, the high hill east of the Point, was named Grant's Hill in his memory. With this defeat, Forbes decided to wait until spring. But when he heard that the French had lostFort Frontenacand largely evacuatedFort Duquesne, he planned an immediate attack. Hopelessly outnumbered, the French abandoned and razed Fort Duquesne. Forbes occupied the burned fort on November 25, 1758, and ordered the construction ofFort Pitt, named after British Secretary of StateWilliam Pitt the Elder. He also named the settlement between the rivers, \"Pittsborough\" (seeEtymology of Pittsburgh).[11][15]The British garrison at Fort Pitt made substantial improvements to its fortification.[11]The French never attacked Fort Pitt and the war soon ended with theTreaty of Parisand French defeat.[15]They ceded their territories east of the Mississippi River."

            "In 1760, the first considerable European settlement around Fort Pitt began to grow. Traders and settlers built two groups of houses and cabins, the \"lower town,\" near the fort's ramparts, and the \"upper town,\" along the Monongahela as far as present-day Market Street. In April 1761, a census ordered by ColonelHenry Bouquetand conducted byWilliam Claphamcounted 332 people and 104 houses.[21][22]: 148",
            "After Britain's victory in the French and Indian War, increasing dissatisfaction among Native Americans with the continuing encroachment of settlers on lands that had been agreed would be Indian-occupied (both in the 1758 Treaty of Easton and in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 the British authorities had decreed that there would be no British-American settlements west of the Alleghenies, but the authorities had been unable or unwilling to enforce these decrees) led to the outbreak ofPontiac's War. TheOdawaleaderPontiaclaunched an offensive against British forts in May 1763. Native American tribes from the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes overran numerous British forts; one of their most important targets was Fort Pitt. Receiving warning of the coming attack, Captain Simeon Ecuyer, the Swiss officer in command of the garrison, prepared for a siege. He leveled the houses outside the ramparts and ordered all settlers into the fort: 330 men, 104 women, and 196 children sought refuge inside its ramparts.[11]Captain Ecuyer also gathered stores, which included hundreds of barrels of pork and beef. Pontiac's forces attacked the fort on June 22, 1763, and thesiege of Fort Pittlasted for two months.[15]Pontiac's warriors kept up a continuous, though ineffective, fire on it from July 27 through August 1, 1763.[21]They drew off to confront the relieving party under Colonel Bouquet, which defeated them in theBattle of Bushy Run.[21]This victory ensured British dominion over the forks of the Ohio, if not the entire Ohio valley. In 1764 Colonel Bouquet added aredoubt, theFort Pitt Blockhouse, which still stands, the sole remaining structure from Fort Pitt and the oldest authenticated building west of theAllegheny Mountains.[15]",
            "TheIroquoissigned theFort Stanwix Treaty of 1768, ceding the lands south of the Ohio to theBritish Crown.[21]European expansion into the upper Ohio valley increased. An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 families settled in western Pennsylvania between 1768 and 1770. Of these settlers, about a third wereEnglish-American, another third wereScotch-Irish, and the rest wereWelsh,Germanand others.[23]These groups tended to settle together in small farming communities, but often their households were not within hailing distance. The life of a settler family was one of relentless hard work: clearing the forest, stumping the fields, building cabins and barns, planting, weeding, and harvesting. In addition, almost everything was manufactured by hand, including furniture, tools, candles, buttons, and needles.[23]Settlers had to deal with harsh winters, and with snakes, black bears, mountain lions, and timber wolves. Because of the fear of raids by Native Americans, the settlers often built their cabins near, or even on top of, springs, to ensure access to water. They also built blockhouses, where neighbors would rally during conflicts.[4]",
            "Increasing violence, especially by theShawnee,Miami, andWyandottribes, led toDunmore's Warin 1774. Conflict with Native Americans continued throughout theRevolutionary War, as some hoped that the war would end with expulsion of the settlers from their territory. In 1777, Fort Pitt became a United States fort, when Brigadier GeneralEdward Handtook command. In 1779, ColonelDaniel Brodheadled 600 men from Fort Pitt to destroySenecavillages along the upper Allegheny.[4]",
            "With the war still ongoing, in 1780 Virginia and Pennsylvania came to an agreement on their mutual borders, creating the state lines known today and determining finally that the jurisdiction of Pittsburgh region was Pennsylvanian. In 1783, the Revolutionary War ended, which also brought at least a temporary cessation of border warfare. In the 1784Treaty of Fort Stanwix, theIroquoisceded the land north of thePurchase Lineto Pennsylvania.[4]",

            "The village began to develop vital institutions.Hugh Henry Brackenridge, a Pittsburgh resident and state legislator, introduced a bill that resulted in a gift deed of land and a charter for the Pittsburgh Academy on February 28, 1787. The academy later developed as the University of Western Pennsylvania (1819) and since 1908 has been known as theUniversity of Pittsburgh.[25]",
            "Many farmers distilled their corn harvest into whiskey, increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs. At that time, whiskey was used as a form of currency on the frontier. When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to theWhiskey Rebellionin 1794. Farmers from the region rallied atBraddock's Fieldand marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states.[20]",

In 1792, the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a sloop,Western Experiment.[26]During the next decades, the yards produced other large boats. By the 19th century, they were building ocean-going vessels that shipped goods as far as Europe. In 1794, the town's first courthouse was built; it was a wooden structure on Market Square.[11]In 1797, the manufacture of glass began.[27]"

TheWar of 1812catalyzed growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.[11]In addition, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K in glass products.[11]When, on March 18, 1816,Pittsburghwas incorporated as a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture, and a constant cloud ofcoal dust.[32]",

This threatened to render the town less essential in east–west commerce. In the coming decade, however, many improvements were made to the transportation infrastructure. In 1818, the region's first river bridge, the Smithfield Street Bridge, opened, the first step in developing the\"City of bridges\"over its two rivers.[citation needed]On October 1, 1840, the original Pennsylvania Turnpike was completed, connecting Pittsburgh and the eastern port city ofPhiladelphia.

These smaller firms were built on a culture that valued local markets and the beneficial role of business in the local community. Small firms concentrated on specialized products, particularly structural steel, where the economies of scale of larger firms were no advantage.

                "Beginning in the 1870s, entrepreneurs transformed the economy from small, craft-organized factories located inside the city limits to a large integrated industrial region stretching 50 miles across Allegheny County. The new industrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills, mass production, and modern management organization in steel and other industries. Many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility. They purchased land, designed modern plants, and sometimes built towns for workers. Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures. Some owners removed their plants from the central city's labor unions to exert greater control over workers. The region's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal. The rapid growth of steel, glass, railroad equipment, and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants and numerous smaller firms. As capital deepened and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, the division of labor increased, and localized production systems formed around these industries. Transportation, capital, labor markets, and the division of labor in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city, surrounded by proximate residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns.[42]",

Caught up in a dramatic round of industrial restructuring and labor tension, Pittsburgh steelmaker George McMurtry hiredFrederick Law Olmsted's landscape architectural firm in 1895 to design Vandergrift as a model town. McMurtry believed in what was later known aswelfare capitalism, with the company going beyond paychecks to provide for the social needs of the workers; he believed that a benign physical environment made for happier and more productive workers. A  strike and lockout at McMurtry's steelworks in Apollo, Pennsylvania, prompted him to build the new town. Wanting a loyal workforce, he developed a town agenda that drew upon environmentalism as well as popular attitudes toward capital's treatment of labor. The Olmsted firm translated this agenda into an urban design that included a unique combination of social reform, comprehensive infrastructure planning, and private homeownership principles. The rates of homeownership and cordial relationships between the steel company and Vandergrift residents fostered loyalty among McMurtry's skilled workers and led to McMurtry's greatest success. In 1901 he used Vandergrift's worker-residents to break the first major strike against theUnited States Steel Corporation.[43]"

Unskilled immigrants found jobs in construction, mining, steel mills and factories. They introduced new traditions, languages, and cultures to the city, creating a diversified society as a result. Ethnic neighborhoods developed in working-class areas and were built on densely populated hillsides and valleys, such asSouth Side,Polish Hill,Bloomfield, andSquirrel Hill, home to 28% of the city's almost 21,000 Jewish households.[59]TheStrip District, the city's produce distribution center, still boasts many restaurants and clubs that showcase these multicultural traditions of Pittsburghers.[39]"

Pittsburgh's black population increased to 37,700 in 1920 (6.4% of the total) while the black element in Homestead, Rankin, Braddock, and others nearly doubled.

However, enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city's working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels. One round of protests came from Italian-American organizations, which called for delay in enforcing it. Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines. Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program, Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949, in part because many of them were on the city payroll.[70]",

In 1976, Landmarks developed the site as a mixed-use historicadaptive reusedevelopment that gave the foundation the opportunity to put its urban planning principles into practice.
